## Train the model
In order to train the model, you have to shoot a good amount of photos (you can use the scripts in this folder, or you can try a different method like saving on the SD card). I tried with 200 photos (100 with my face covered, the other with my bare face): the system works, but I know that 200 are too few.
The resolution of the photos had to be dropped to 670x488, otherwise the model would be too heavy for the Raspberry PI 4 (I didn't try on the 5 as I don't have one yet).
